    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>Google LLC is an American multinational technology company focusing on search engine technology, online
        advertising, cloud computing, computer software, quantum computing, e-commerce, artificial intelligence, and
        consumer electronics.Most Android phones come with a suite of Google apps already pre-installed, such as Gmail,
        YouTube, Google Chrome, GPay, Google Maps, etc. Phone developers must license Android from Google, and one of
        the terms and conditions is that they include Google’s suite of apps. This will now change. According to
        Google’s blog post on the issue, “OEMs will be able to license individual Google apps for pre-installation on
        their devices.” So it means an OEM will no longer be forced to pre-install these apps.

        But it should be pointed out that most Android phones, regardless of price points, come with several
        pre-installed apps, and not all of these are from Google. Many of these other apps, pushed by the manufacturer,
        add no value to the user. Typically, these are referred to as ‘bloatware’, and it will likely continue on most
        phones.</p>
